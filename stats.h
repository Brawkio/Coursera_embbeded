/*
 * @brief Prints the statistics of an array
 *
 * Prints the value of the maximum, minimum, the mean and the median of an array of data.
 *
 * @param unsigned char *array Pointer that takes the direction of the data array and thus, its values.
 * @param unsigned int n_elements Number of the data array's elements.
 *
 * @return It doesn't return any value, just prints the statistics of the array

 * @brief <Prints the data of an array to the screen>
 *
 * Using the printf function, it displays the values contained in an array of data in a nice formatted way.

 * @param unsigned char *array Pointer that takes the direction of the data array and thus, its values.
 * @param unsigned int n_elements Number of the data array's elements.

 * @brief Computes the median value of an array
 *
 * From a sorted array of data, the median is obtained taking into account the two possible cases, an even or an odd number of elements.

 * @param unsigned int n_elements Number of the data array's elements.
